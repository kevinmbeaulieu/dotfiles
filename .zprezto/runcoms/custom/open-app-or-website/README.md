I recommend creating an alias such as `o` for `open-app-or-website` to streamline its use.


To open an application, run commands of the following format:

`open-app-or-website safari`

`open-app-or-website messages`


To open a website, run commands of the following format:

`open-app-or-website facebook` (opens `https://facebook.com`)

`open-app-or-website cornell.edu` (opens `https://cornell.edu`)

`open-app-or-website http://www.google.com` (opens `http://www.google.com`)

`open-app-or-website github.com/kevinmbeaulieu/dotfiles`
(opens `https://github.com/kevinmbeaulieu/dotfiles`)


To open the browser to its default homepage, run with no arguments (`open-app-or-website`)
